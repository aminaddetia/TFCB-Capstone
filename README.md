# TFCB capstone

## Project Overview

Here, I analyzed a dataset that examined various features in healthy and glaucoma-positive individuals. I centered by analysis on the three questions below and I used programming skills I learned this past quarter in TFCB to answer these questions.
1. Are certain measured factors better predictors of glaucoma status for particular age groups or are all factors equally good predictors of glaucoma status regardless of an individual's age?
2. Is the chosen RNFL mean thickness value the best value for distinguishing between the glaucoma-positive and glaucoma-negative individuals or does a better value exist?
3. How similar are the training and test dataset?

## Data

The data used for this project were collected by Kim, et al., and analyzed in their manuscript [Development of machine learning models for diagnosis of glaucoma](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0177726). The dataset is also available on [Dryad](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.q6ft5). Additionally, the data are available in the [data](data) directory.

## Project Organization

Raw data used in this analysis are available in the [data](data) directory. The code is split between an [R markdown](TFCB_capstone_report1.Rmd) and [Jupyter Notebook](TFCB_capstone_report2.ipynb). Results are available in the [results](results) folder.

## About the analysis

The following software and version were used:
- Jupyter Notebook version 6.0.3
- Python 3.8.3
- RStudio 1.3.1093
- R versions 4.0.2
